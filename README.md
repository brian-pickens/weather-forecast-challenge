# weather-forecast-challenge

Here at Sunny Corp, we would like to build a new internal portal to display the current local weather for our employees.

## Requirements

- I recommend starting by forking this repository
- The weather should be for the users current location using the browser location capability
- Display the current weather (sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc...) with relevant icon
- Display the current tempurature with relevant icon
- Display the wind speed and wind direction with relevant icon
- Unit tests should be present with at least 50% coverage
- All other resources or tools you use are completely up to you

## Resources

- [Icon Set Demo](http://demo.amitjakhu.com/dripicons-weather/)
- [Icon Set Download](https://github.com/amitjakhu/dripicons-weather)
- [Free Weather API](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs)
- [Angular Setup Docs](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local)

This should be enough to get you started. Good luck!
